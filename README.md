Installing the gem
In order to run the install generator from tailwindcss you need to add the webpacker gem, and run the installation setup for it.

Installing webpacker + tailwindcss
tailwindcss-rails ~> 1.0.0 supports Rails ~>5.2.0 and tailwindcss ~> 1.0

You first need to add the following gems to your Gemfile:

# Gemfile
gem 'webpacker', '~> 4.0.0'
gem 'tailwindcss', '~> 1.0.0'
Run the following:

bundle

bundle exec rails webpacker:install

bundle exec rails g tailwindcss:install
This will prepare the application to use tailwind by:

Adding tailwind by using yarn
Create a javascript/css directory
Init tailwind from the node_modules
Setup tailwind
Configure postcss.config.js file
If you want to know how this is achieved, you can go here.

These two lines will compile the assets from the app/javascript/css folder.

You must add the following to your config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb:

  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|
    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?
  end
Inside of config/webpacker.yml, you must set extract_css: true default is false.

You have to add these two lines to your application layout in order to compile it.

<%= stylesheet_pack_tag    'application' %>
<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %>
Webpacker will automatically compile your assets while a bundle exec rails s is active.
